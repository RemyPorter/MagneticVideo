# Magnetic Video
This simple processing sketch grabs frames from your webcam to create a video effect that resembles iron filings under a magnet. Based on the luminance and brightness of each "sample point" in the video, a "/" shape is drawn to the screen.

At the same time, a bunch of tone generators are watching those slashes, changing their pitch in response to how large the deflection angle is for a group of them (by default, there's one tone generator for every 640 "/"s). This is a very "lo-fi", grungy sort of sound. Sometimes it sounds almost like babbling.

The results can be a little odd, but interesting.
